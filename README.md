**Graduate Student Assistant @ SUNY Albany**  
**Data Analyst | Reporting | Visualization | Data-Driven Insights**

Currently working as a **Graduate Student Assistant** and actively seeking **full-time opportunities** in **Data Analytics**.

- I'm currently doing a project on International Students Community Platform along with my teammates at our Univerity. There are many difficulties which international students face even in this fast paced technological world. Some of them would be finding new friends, building network, culture shock, language barrier, and finding a place to live. Hence, our project aims to establish a trust worthy platform where living abroad becomes less stressful/complicated for the international students. Here the International students can form connections with peers from around the world. The intended audience consists of overseas students who are attempting to adjust and make a fresh start.
We are creating a website and the basic operations will be signing-in with the user credentials and on a login page. The new users can log in and express their needs and the existing users can assist new users by communicating. In order to secure the confidentiality of the conversation, we included privacy options such as "private," "public," and "only me."
The technologies we are using are:
    • Front end – HTML, CSS, Javascript
    1. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It describes the structure of webpages.

    2. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed.

    3. Javascript – It is known as the programming language of the web
    • Back end – Django
Django is a back end server side web Framework it makes easier to build web pages using python. It Take cares of difficult stuff so that we can focus on building the web application.
Django follows MVT pattern design (Model, view, template). Usually located in files like model.py, views.py, template will be located in folder name template.
This is how Django works:
    1. Django will receive the URL, checks urls.py file, and calls the view which matches with the URL.
    2. The view which is located in views.py, checks for the relevant models.
    3. The models then are imported from models.py file.
    4. The view then will send the data to a specified template in the template folder

    • Database – Mysql
MySql is a free and open source which is used as a relational database management system.
Windows is an open source operating system which is preferred by many web developers due to its flexibility, stability and customizing options.
The Outcomes of this project will be:
    • International Students can access information regarding safe and friendly neighborhoods.
    • Build their network
    • Making their transition to a new country smoother
    • Makes it easy for students to find a place to live.
Working on these coupled technologies will give me practical experience and a foundational understanding of front-end and back-end programming. Working in a group will provide me expertise with planning and time management. My own objectives are to improve my technical skills and understanding.
